        <strong>Summary</strong><br>
        My experience with MotusVR taught me so much about project management, teamwork, design and user experience. I gained significant experience in user-centered product design, particularly for specialized user groups with reduced mobility. I honed my skills in gathering and analyzing requirements, using tools like UML diagrams to translate initial concepts into detailed specifications. I also learned the value of iterative design and rapid prototyping, constantly refining our game based on testing and feedback.

Skills I Learned
User-Centered Design: Focused on accessibility, customization, and ease of use to meet the needs of users with reduced mobility in care settings.

Requirements Gathering & Analysis: Conducted textual analysis, identified actors/use cases, and created activity/sequence diagrams to refine project specifications.

Prototyping & Iterative Design: Used rapid prototyping and playtesting to continuously refine game design and functionality.

UI Design: Simplified menu structures, enhanced readability, and improved visual accessibility through user-informed layout decisions.

Communication & Collaboration: Practiced clear communication through team meetings, paired programming, and design justification discussions.

Problem-Solving & Adaptation: Overcame technical challenges (e.g., Unreal Engine access, performance issues) with creative solutions like asset optimization.

User Testing & Feedback Integration: Actively gathered and applied user feedback to improve gameplay, accessibility, and level design.
